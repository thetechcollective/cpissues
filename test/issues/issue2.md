# Feature Request: Dark Mode Support

## Description

Many users, including myself, prefer using applications in dark mode, especially during late hours. Implementing a dark mode theme can improve the visual comfort and overall user experience.

## Benefits

- **Reduced Eye Strain**: Dark mode can reduce eye strain in low-light conditions.
- **Energy Efficiency**: On OLED and AMOLED screens, dark mode can reduce power consumption.
- **Aesthetic Preference**: Some users simply prefer the look of dark mode.

## Implementation Considerations

- The dark mode theme should be easily toggleable from the user settings.
- Ensure that all UI elements are clearly visible in both light and dark modes.
- Test contrast ratios to meet accessibility standards.

## Examples

Here's how a similar application implemented dark mode:
